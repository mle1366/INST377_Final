# Title: INST377- Final Project - Find the Right Makeup Product
# Description of project: Finding the right type of makeup is difficult as it is not one-size-fits-all and makeup products can be expensive. For this project, I will be creating a system that will help those who are interested in makeup find the perfect product for them. My system will help users find makeup products that best fit them by including a filtering system for allergies and take into account their budgets.
